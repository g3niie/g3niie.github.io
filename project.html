          Welcome to my higherlower Project! This was our first ever school project that we had to make. For this project I got a 5,8. Which obviously, I'm not mad about
          And this is also my first ever project that I had to make with the basic experience of HTML/CSS and JS. Overal this was a fun project to work and would definitely want to make it again and better!

        <p>
          In the photo above is my project called "TicTacToe", or like my class says. "BOETRO CHEEKS SEGGSS". For this project I got a 6.2, which in my opinion is fair enough for me.
          Since I made the entire game in 2 weeks and actually had it completed. But for the rest, this was a very big trail and error experience that I genuinely enjoyed working on and always had fun testing.

          This is the dashboard project. This was a group project that me and my two others made. For this project we all got a 6. This project was not that hard in my own opinion, it was more tedious to learn how to use fetch for the project.
          For the rest I am pretty happy with the grade for this project and how the teamwork went between us.
