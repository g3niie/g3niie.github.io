        <p>
          Welcome to my higherlower Project! This was our first ever school project that we had to make. For this
          project I got a 5,8. Which obviously, I'm not mad about
          And this is also my first ever project that I had to make with the basic experience of HTML/CSS and JS. Overal
          this was a fun project to work and would definitely want to make it again and better!

        <p>
          In the photo above is my project called "TicTacToe", or like my class says. "BOETRO CHEEKS SEGGSS". For this
          project I got a 6.2, which in my opinion is fair enough for me.
          Since I made the entire game in 2 weeks and actually had it completed. But for the rest, this was a very big
          trail and error experience that I genuinely enjoyed working on and always had fun testing.

        <p>
          This is the Webcatalogus project. This was a group project that me and my two others made. For this project we
          all got a 6. This project was not that hard in my own opinion, it was more tedious to learn how to use fetch
          for the project.
          For the rest I am pretty happy with the grade for this project and how the teamwork went between us.

          This is the "Theweek 1" project. This was a group project me and my two other friends worked on. For this project we got a 7.5, and I was extremely proud of it. This project also tested my patience
          and also made me not be lazy and make my friends in the group proud. In general this project for me was allot of fun to do and allot of brain pain which I didn't mind.

        <p>
          This is the "Theweek 2" project. This was a solo project that I had to do on my own with the help of some of my classmates now and then when I didn't understand something
          For this project, I got a 7.5 which I am extremely proud of, mostly because this showed how much better I have gotten with coding and shows how much I have learned from this schoolyear alone.
          For the rest this project very fun and very stressfull to do and I am beyond proud that it turned out this good.
