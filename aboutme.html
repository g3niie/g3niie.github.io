                    Welcome to the about me part of my website! Here you can learn allot more about
                    who I am and where I am from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So a quick little introduction on who I am. My name is Jyotish Baidjnath and I am from the
                    Carribeans and have lived there
                    for over 16 years. I am 18 years old I go to the school ROC Mondriaan in the Subject Software
                    Developing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I said in the little introduction, I have lived 16 years of my life in the Caribbeans and never
                    moved from there to live somewhere else.
                    I have mostly lived allot of my years, the only real friends I have are either online friends or my
                    two best friends I have know for over 8 years.
                    I have always been a really laid back person and I love to play games and read books in my free
                    time. My all time Favorite hobbyâ€™s are listening to
                    Music and swimming. I Have not failed any of classes before going into HAVO 4. I have done my full 4
                    years of VMBO In two different
                    schools. Before I got to the Netherlands I did HAVO 3 and then did a year of HAVO 4 before having
                    the decision to not do HAVO anymore.
                    The main reason why moving to the Netherlands was a must for me and my family was because I lived in
                    a really corrupted place, so my
                    family were close to not earning enough money. So my mom and dad decided to move from the Caribbeans
                    to the Netherlands and I am very
                    glad that they made that decision. At first I was hesitant towards the idea of moving here but
                    overtime I got used to it.

                        In this part of my about me page, I am going to be talking about the reason I chose Software
                        Developing. Before I
                        did MBO I was studying in the HAVO school Edith Stein College. But overtime I started to realize
                        that this is not what I wanted
                        to do so I decided to talk to my dad about it before the schoolyear ended.
                    </p>
                    <button class="switch-case-button1 hidden">Next page</button>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-2"></div>
                <div class="col-md-5 switch-case-2 hidden">
                    <p>
                        We talked about how HAVO is not for me and how it is for tbe bettr that I go to MBO now before
                        its to late.
                        And after we talked about it for about two days we came to the final decicion that I will be
                        doing MBO. From then I decided to
                        work on myself and my MBO diploma.
